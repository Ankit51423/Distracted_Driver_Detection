Data
The data used in this project is from the State Farm Distracted Driver Detection competition on Kaggle. The dataset includes images of drivers in various states of distraction.

Model
The model is built using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images of drivers into different categories of distraction. The architecture and training details are available in the Jupyter notebook.

Results
The performance of the model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Detailed results and analysis can be found in the Jupyter notebook.
